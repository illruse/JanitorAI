# JanitorAI
Hidden Character Definitions, Scenarios, and Example Dialogs of many bots, compiled together to be able to clone and edit bots easily.

DISCLAIMER: This is a personal repository and I am not responsible for the people who clone it. Thanks!

Format for files is as follows:

"BOT NAME_BOT CREATOR"

Paid requests will be marked as "[PAID]"

These are all text files along with details (bot name, tags, original creator, etc.)

Replace all mentions of "IllRuse" with "{{user}}", and the character name with "{{char}}", excluding quotations

Future Plans: Write a Python bot to automate the extraction process with a single command, then possibly release the source code of that program so people can do it themselves.

AI should be free.

Additionally, fuck OpenAI
